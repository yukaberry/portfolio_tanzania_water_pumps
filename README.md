# Project : Data Science Classification Problem
# Detect faluty water pumps in Tanzania

The objective of this project: To pridect which water pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work by using given dataset from the competition platform. [Here to find out more about the project report](), which contains below.

# Motivation

Interested in processing **geospatial data** and taking my understandings to a next level to deepen data science knowledge and skills. This problem has both categorical and numeric features, and multi-labels. This project spotlights **data visualisaiton** as well as **preprocessing and modeling**.
